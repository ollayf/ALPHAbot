Hello! My name is R2-E2! My job is to assist in the administrative efforts of NUS E2. Please cooperate with me as much \
as you can :)!!

What can you do with me?
As a normal member the simple commands you can do are:
/events
/library
/feedback (Though you would need to start a convo with me to use this)
At any time, use /help to check the list of possible commands for you. I hope we would get to know each other more
as we interact with each other!

P.S. ALL COMMANDS work SEAMLESSLY on pm and in group as long as you have started me before. So feel free to use me whenever and
whereever you want to! :)
