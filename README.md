This is the ALPHAbot created for NS-Alpha LG to assist in administration for the entire lifegroup
This is mainly done so by:
    1. Storing upcoming events
    2. Giving timely reminders as these events are approaching
    3. Storing recent sermons that LG members may have missed
    4. Sending broadcasts to all members via pm
    5. Spamming the group when a call (i.e. on Zoom is started)
    6. Staying cool while doing all these

## Running it using docker
$ docker build DockerFile
$ docker run <image name>
